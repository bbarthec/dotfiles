# If a file called .chezmoiignore exists in the source state then it is interpreted as a set of patterns to ignore.
# Patterns can be excluded by prefixing them with a ! character. All excludes take priority over all includes.

# Comments are introduced with the # character and run until the end of the line.
# .chezmoiignore is interpreted as a template. This allows different files to be ignored on different machines.
# .chezmoiignore files in subdirectories apply only to that subdirectory.

# ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiignore
